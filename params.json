You are welcome to contribute code. You can send code both as a patch or a GitHub pull request.\r\n\r\nBuild Status\r\n------------\r\n\r\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/dadcbt26mrlri8cg)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/lontivero/open-nat)\r\n\r\n[![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/open.nat.png)](http://badge.fury.io/nu/open.nat)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that Open.Nat is still very much work in progress. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
